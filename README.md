# NILMTK: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring Toolkit

Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is the process of estimating the
energy consumed by individual appliances given just a whole-house
power meter reading.  In other words, it produces an (estimated)
itemised energy bill from just a single, whole-house power meter.

NILM is sometimes called:

* "non-intrusive appliance load monitoring (NALM or NIALM)"
* "[electriciy | energy | smart meter] disaggregation"

NILMTK is a toolkit designed to help *researchers* evaluate the
accuracy of NILM algorithms. **NILMTK is not yet suitable for end
users because NILMTK is not yet capable of out-of-the-box
disaggregation (i.e. disaggregation where you do not yet have
submetered training data), although we hope that it might be some time
in the future**.


# Why a toolkit for NILM?

We quote our [NILMTK paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.3878v1.pdf)
explaining the need for a NILM toolkit:

  > Empirically comparing disaggregation algorithms is currently
  > virtually impossible. This is due to the different data sets used,
  > the lack of reference implementations of these algorithms and the
  > variety of accuracy metrics employed.


# What NILMTK provides

To address this challenge, we present the Non-intrusive Load Monitoring
Toolkit (NILMTK); an open source toolkit designed specifically to enable
the comparison of energy disaggregation algorithms in a reproducible
manner. This work is the first research to compare multiple
disaggregation approaches across multiple publicly available data sets.
NILMTK includes:

-  parsers for a range of existing data sets (8 and counting)
-  a collection of preprocessing algorithms
-  a set of statistics for describing data sets
-  a number of [reference benchmark disaggregation algorithms](https://github.com/nilmtk/nilmtk/wiki/NILM-Algorithms)
-  a common set of accuracy metrics
-  and much more!
